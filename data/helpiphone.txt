<A NAME="background"><H1>STORY BACKGROUND</H1></A>
<H2>The year is 2065 and mega corporations rule the galaxy. Two of the largest companies, ACME Exploration and OMNI Industries, are vying for dominance in the mining of an extremely rare and incredibly valuable mineral called Galaxite. Galaxite can be used to 'rip' particles from one location to another almost instantly and over any distance. This is accomplished by creating matching quirk fields which, when synchronized, create a momentary Einstein-Rosen wormhole bridge between the two locations. OMNI Industries is the largest corporation in existence with a Gross National Product (GNP) that exceeds that of all but the richest countries. OMNI has a stranglehold on a variety of different markets ranging from diamonds to Galaxite mining. ACME Exploration is the second largest corporation in existence and is urgently trying to secure the number 1 spot.<BR>
Six weeks ago an ACME owned, unmanned probe en route to the star Tau Ceti reported back that an unexplored planet, Icarus, contained 'massive' Galaxite deposits. ACME has dispatched a colony ship to the location. On board are Gordon Fox, Mining Base Commander, Jana Perez, a Senior Research Scientist, her fiance, Andy Whitmore, a Mining Operations Trainee, and Arthur Olstrom, a Sr. Mining Executive; it includes the equipment and people necessary to exploit and defend their claim. If ACME can successfully claim Icarus it may well become the richest and most powerful mega corporation of them all!</H2>

<A NAME="howtoplay"><H1>GAME PLAY CONTROLS </H1></A>
<H2>The best way to learn the game play controls is to play <A HREF="#newgame">M0: Introduction</A>, which will introduce the game play elements to you as you play. Briefly, to move a unit, tap on the unit, then tap on the destination. To move multiple units, multi-select the units then tap on the destination. To multi-select, touch two fingers on the map to get a selection rectangle. Drag one or two corners to move and size the rectangle around the units you wish to select. To attack, select your desired units, then tap on the enemy unit you wish to attack.</H2>

<A NAME="upgrades"><H1>Research Upgrades </H1></A>
<BR>
<H2>Research upgrades allow you to improve the units available at your Human Resource Center (HRC) and Vehicle Transport Station (VTS). The Research & Development Center is available starting on Mission 3. Select this building and use the build icon to view available upgrades. Upgrading the HRC enables production of Rocket Troopers and later Corporate Raiders. Upgrading the VTS enables production of Dominions, Cyclops and other advanced tanks. Not all upgrades are available in all missions. It is worth noting that even after you have upgraded your HRC, the R&D Center must survive to enable production of <A HREF="#corporateraider">Corporate Raiders</A>. Therefore you cannot sell this building if you wish to produce these very special units.<BR>

<A NAME="authoring"><H1>Authoring Add-On Mission Packs </H1></A>
<H2>Players can create new Add-On Mission Packs using the mission authoring toolkit. Using this tool, you can design, test, and share the missions you have authored with the player community. To begin, visit the Mission Authoring section of the Hostile Takeover forums and read everything there. Once you have a mission pack that you want to test, you'll want to get it on to your device. To do this, upload your mission to any location on the internet. Start the game, tap on Add-On Mission Packs. Tap on the Title label to sort by name, and you'll see "Custom URL..." near the top. Tap on this and select DOWNLOAD, and enter the custom URL to your mission pack and tap OK, and it will be downloaded to your device. Now you can play and refine your mission pack until it is ready to share with the community. To share it, visit the Mission Sharing section of the website for instructions on how to post it there. Posting it there will add it to the Add-On Mission Pack list that all players see.</H2>
